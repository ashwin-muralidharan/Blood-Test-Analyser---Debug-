# 🧪 Blood Test Report Analyser - Debugged Version

This project is a FastAPI application that uses CrewAI agents to analyze blood test reports and provide recommendations.

---

## Bugs Found and How They Were Fixed

**1️⃣ Incorrect and deprecated imports**

- **Problem:** `from crewai.agents import Agent` failed.
- **Fix:** Corrected to `from crewai import Agent`.
- **Problem:** `OpenAIGPT` was deprecated.
- **Fix:** Removed `OpenAIGPT` and used default LLM configuration.

**2️⃣ Tasks missing required parameters**

- **Problem:** `expected_output` was missing in Tasks.
- **Fix:** Added `expected_output` descriptions to all tasks.

**3️⃣ Tools were functions instead of BaseTool instances**

- **Problem:** Tools were declared as functions, causing validation errors.
- **Fix:** Converted tools to classes inheriting from `BaseTool`.

**4️⃣ Dependency conflicts**

- **Problem:** Incompatible versions of `pydantic` and `openai`.
- **Fix:** Updated `requirements.txt` to compatible versions.

**5️⃣ Missing dependencies**

- **Problem:** `python-multipart` was missing, causing FastAPI upload errors.
- **Fix:** Installed `python-multipart`.

**6️⃣ API key handling**

- **Problem:** `.env` was not created or ignored.
- **Fix:** Added `.env` with your OpenAI key and included `.env` in `.gitignore`.

**7️⃣ Uvicorn reload issues**

- **Problem:** Running `main.py` directly with `reload=True` caused errors.
- **Fix:** Switched to using `uvicorn main:app` from CLI.
